### Should Designers Code?
There are countless articles and blog posts debating the skillsets required for UX Designers, UI Designers, "Full-Stack" Designers, and so on. Many of these come with strong opinions on the right amount (if any) of coding knowledge necessary for designers to possess and unfortunately, these often dogmatic views leave little room for nuance. Personally, I think it's the wrong question to ask - it's not a matter of "designers coding", but rather **how much designers should know about a process and discipline that is so primary to realizing their efforts**. Perhaps it might help to try to unpack what people are really debating, and look for pragmatic positions that support a better way of working.

### A Word About Unicorns
The concept of a UX Unicorn evokes strong responses, but generally you will hear variations of two arguments: 
1. Unicorns as a myth - Generalists in all disciplines across the UX spectrum will never perform as well as specialists in a given area
2. Unicorns are elusive, but they exist - Well-rounded UX designers , T-shaped, blahg blaha akihak

I think something Mythi. Tshaped to square shaped, blaasd ;lasdj lakdsjlk;adsj as;ldj;laksdj  a;lsdj a;lsdj  a;lsdj a;lsdj


### ~~Mythical Unicorns~~
~~My intuition is that many of the positions people are staking out regarding the various skillsets and roles are largely reactions to the conflation of skillsets and job titles demanding expertise in a broad range of disciplines. We've all encountered job postings for UX "teams of one" with requirements including user research, information architecture, wireframing, visual and interaction design, user testing, and development skills. I think we can all agree that those skillsets are rarely if ever possessed by one person, and in practice, those skillsets would typically be covered by 3-4+ people depending on the maturity of the organization, its processes, and resources.~~  

~~Quite naturally, these unicorn postings evoke quite a reaction among professional UX practitioners. Sensitive to the integrity of the profession, conflation of responsibilities, and justifiably worried about the flood of unqualified "UX Designers" diluting the market, a typical response would include various diagrams explaining the difference between UX and UI and is sometimes accompanied with a large dose of self-importance disguised as education for those unacquainted with the difference. This is a huge turnoff, and I'm guessing it's not just me.~~

~~Yes, I'm sure there are companies trying to save money, cut corners, and consolidate positions, but I'm afraid that will always be the case. Should we try to educate others on the different disciplines under the UX tent? Absolutely! but let's approach it in the same way we might any other problem we tackle - meeting people where the are with empathy, context, and recognizing intent. When we are dismissive to others' intentions because they have blurred some UX responsibilities in a job posting, online thread, or article, we might score short-term internet points with peers, but are we gaining any ground in the long term?~~

### Expanding Considerations
While no one would argue that we shouldn't understand and users' motivations, systems, and constraints, it would seem as a profession we are largely neglecting to understand those same considerations for our developer counterparts. It's quite easy and somewhat common to live in a UX world that is focused on journey maps, personas, and wireframes which are handed off to a development team for implementation. Hopefully processes are in place to facilitate a feedback loop among the development team, design team, and product owner to deal with the inevitable back-and-forth that will occur in the course of delivering a feature. However, without a mature team or process in place, a black box period may occur in the time between deliverying designs and the delivery of the feature in which assumptions are made (often wrongly) in order to complete a story or task. This black box period is more likely to happen when UX resources are separated from the development team organizationally or physically, and
