### Books 
Ok, so these are books, but they are also audiobooks. I've been an audible member for almost 10 years, and I can't say I would have read these titles without the convenience of listening via my phone on the way to work, at the gym, or walking the dog. In any case, I'm adding a few titles that merit mention... Your tastes may vary, but if you are at all interested in these topics, I would recommend putting these in your listening/reading queue.
