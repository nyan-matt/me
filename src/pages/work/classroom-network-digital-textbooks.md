summary: >
  This page includes various work I produced while a in a Product Strategy Role at Texas Instruments between 2010-2012. This is an extension of my prior work on the TI-Navigator Classroom Network for graphing calculators pivoting emphasis to tablet based apps and digital math textbooks paired with a teacher desktop software.

  Senior UX Designer, Product Strategy


  In this role, part of my responsibilities included producing concepts for future products and services. These designs were exploring how networked digital textbooks and other formative assessment tools could be used in the emerging tablet market.

  #### Retro
  During 10+ years at Texas Instruments, much of my early career focused on designing embedded software that ran on monochromatic, low-resolution screens controlled by a physical keypad without the luxury of a pointing device. When mobile touch devices like the iPod touch and iPhone were released, it was delightful to reimagine design & interactions without legacy constraints. This exercise also demonstrated how we might take a monolithic, general purpose math & science product such as a graphing calculator to be used across multiple subjects, and split those feature sets into single-purpose, streamlined experiences that could stand alone and provide more intuitive interfaces.

### Background
In the early 2000s, TI introduced a classroom network system that allowed teachers to send quizzes and tests to students for completion on their graphing calculators. Results could be aggregated and added to a gradebook from the teacher's laptop computer. Functionality was later added to allow for students to participate in polling and collaborative classroom activities.   

Although the system could be engaging, it required new hardware, software, and suffered from a complicated setup process that some users found too troublesome for everyday usage. 

With growing adoption of iPads in the classroom, I was tasked with exploring what a classroom network could look like with tablet clients rather than graphing calculators. During this time, there was also a push for states to adopt Core Core State Standards into their curriculum. 

### Personas
Example personas for various stakeholders.

### Concepts 
Concepts for teacher software to manage and orchestrate formative assessments such as quizzes, polls, and other activities.

### Networked Digital Textbooks
Traditional textbooks typically introduce concepts with examples and practice questions. Instructional technology (such as graphing calculators) are often used as standalone tools that help reinforce or explore the lesson, and a separate quiz or test is used to measure student understanding. This process can be quite inefficient and requires a fair amount of task switching where intructional time is spent on adminsistrative tasks, and in many cases, the teacher is not aware of the class understanding until quizzes and tests are administered and graded. 

Although digital textbooks were not new, they mostly represented 1:1 digital copies of their hardcover counterparts. While there were some inherent advantages to this, their usage in the classroom still basically followed the existing pattern (concept introduction, practice / exploration, assessment). For these concepts, I wanted to illustrate how a truly interactive digital textbook could streamline the process - providing the concepts, exploratory tools, and formative assessment into a networked experience.
