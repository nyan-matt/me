summary: >
  This project includes various work I produced while a in a Product Strategy Role at Texas Instruments in the mid-late 2000s. While TI Education Technology was a staple in a majority of Math & Science classrooms for much of the past 20 years, low-cost disruptors (iPod Touch, iPhones, Tablets) were becoming an attractive platform for our customers. This work represents product concept ideation around mobile app offerings to diversify outside of hardware products.

  Senior UX Designer, Product Strategy


  In this role, part of my responsibilities included producing concepts for future products and services. These designs are likely from 2007-2010 when touch devices were gaining popularity in consumer electronics, and this exploration was used to help visualize what a touch offering or "app" might look like in a product portfolio.

  #### Retro
  During 10+ years at Texas Instruments, much of my early career focused on designing embedded software that ran on monochromatic, low-resolution screens controlled by a physical keypad without the luxury of a pointing device. When mobile touch devices like the iPod touch and iPhone were released, it was delightful to reimagine design & interactions without legacy constraints. This exercise also demonstrated how we might take a monolithic, general purpose math & science product such as a graphing calculator to be used across multiple subjects, and split those feature sets into single-purpose, streamlined experiences that could stand alone and provide more intuitive interfaces.

### Background
Traditional hardware-based products (such as graphing calculators) can have long development and manufacturing cycle times. While specialized toward secondary Math & Science education, they tend to require training in order for users (teachers and students) to accomplish various tasks needed by different subjects and curriculum. Designing an embedded interface (at 320x240) to quickly and easily accommodate those needs is challenging.

With the introduction of touch-based devices and app architecture into the EdTech space, specialized applications provided more streamlined, focused experiences that required little to no training and represented a real disruption to traditional business models.

### Sketches & Ideation
Low & hi-fidelity designs for a touch application version of TI-Nspire graphing software.
